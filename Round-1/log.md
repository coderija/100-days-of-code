### Day 0/100. Dec 10, 2022
**Today's Progress**: Reviewed HTML tags and advanced to step 44 on FCC course.
**Thoughts:** I enjoyed learning HTML. It was easy for me since I already have some HTML knowledge. I skipped to step 40 because I already know the essential parts of it.
Struggle with keeping myself focusing but I made it eventually.
